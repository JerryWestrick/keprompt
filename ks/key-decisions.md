# KePrompt Key Design Decisions

## CLI as Primary Interface

### Decision
Make command-line interface the primary way to interact with KePrompt, rather than a Python library or HTTP API.

### Rationale
- **Language Agnostic**: Any programming language can call subprocess to execute CLI commands
- **Simple Integration**: No need to maintain SDKs for different languages
- **Debugging**: `--debug` flag provides immediate visibility into execution
- **Deployment**: No additional services to deploy or manage
- **Shell Integration**: Natural fit for scripts, CI/CD, and automation

### Trade-offs
- **Performance**: Subprocess overhead vs direct library calls
- **Error Handling**: Must parse stdout/stderr vs structured exceptions
- **Type Safety**: String-based parameters vs typed interfaces

## Statement-Based Prompt Language

### Decision
Create a domain-specific language with line-based statements (`.user`, `.system`, `.exec`) rather than using pure text or JSON.

### Rationale
- **Readability**: Clear separation between different types of content
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new statement types
- **Variable Substitution**: Built-in `<<variable>>` syntax
- **Function Integration**: `.cmd` statements for external operations
- **Debugging**: Each statement can be traced and logged individually

### Trade-offs
- **Learning Curve**: Users must learn the prompt language syntax
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple text templates
- **Parsing**: Requires custom parser vs standard formats

## Provider Abstraction Layer

### Decision
Abstract AI providers behind a common interface rather than exposing provider-specific APIs.

### Rationale
- **Model Agnostic**: Switch providers without changing prompts
- **Cost Optimization**: Easy to compare and migrate between providers
- **Future Proofing**: New providers can be added without breaking existing prompts
- **Unified Features**: Common interface for token counting, cost calculation, etc.

### Trade-offs
- **Feature Limitations**: Lowest common denominator of provider features
- **Maintenance**: Must keep up with changes across multiple providers
- **Performance**: Additional abstraction layer overhead

## File-Based Configuration

### Decision
Store model definitions, functions, and prompts as files rather than in a database.

### Rationale
- **Version Control**: All configuration can be versioned with git
- **Simplicity**: No database setup or management required
- **Transparency**: Easy to inspect and modify configuration
- **Portability**: Configuration travels with the codebase
- **Backup**: Automatic backup through version control

### Trade-offs
- **Performance**: File I/O vs in-memory or database lookups
- **Concurrency**: File locking issues with concurrent access
- **Scalability**: May not scale to very large numbers of prompts/models

## Function System Design

### Decision
Implement functions as executable files that communicate via JSON rather than as Python modules.

### Rationale
- **Language Flexibility**: Functions can be written in any language
- **Isolation**: Function failures don't crash the main process
- **Security**: Functions run in separate processes with limited access
- **Extensibility**: Easy for users to add custom functions
- **Debugging**: Function execution can be traced and logged

### Trade-offs
- **Performance**: Process spawning overhead vs direct function calls
- **Complexity**: JSON serialization vs direct parameter passing
- **Error Handling**: Must handle process failures and timeouts

## Conversation State Management

### Decision
Implement conversation persistence as JSON files rather than using a database or in-memory storage.

### Rationale
- **Simplicity**: No database setup required
- **Portability**: Conversations can be moved between environments
- **Debugging**: Easy to inspect conversation state
- **Backup**: Conversations are automatically backed up as files
- **Version Control**: Conversation templates can be versioned

### Trade-offs
- **Performance**: File I/O for each conversation operation
- **Concurrency**: Potential file locking issues
- **Scalability**: May not scale to very large numbers of concurrent conversations

## Cost Tracking Integration

### Decision
Build cost tracking directly into the core execution engine rather than as an optional add-on.

### Rationale
- **Production Ready**: Cost awareness is essential for production AI systems
- **Transparency**: Users always know what operations cost
- **Optimization**: Enables cost-based model selection and optimization
- **Budgeting**: Supports cost controls and alerting
- **Accountability**: Clear audit trail of AI spending

### Trade-offs
- **Complexity**: Additional code and maintenance burden
- **Accuracy**: Must keep pricing data current across providers
- **Performance**: Additional logging and calculation overhead
