# Draft: Terms Identified for Inclusion in the Ontology

This file lists the aligned terms we have already agreed upon conceptually and may include in `01-ontology.md` after final confirmation.

## Candidate Terms

## Term: Concept Alignment
Meaning: The deliberate use of precise language to activate the correct region of an LLM’s pretrained semantic space while suppressing irrelevant meanings.

## Term: Semantic Cluster
Meaning: The set of related concepts activated within an LLM’s latent knowledge space when a specific term or phrase is used.

## Term: Prompt Lifecycle Management
Meaning: The external process by which prompts evolve over time independently of the host application, supported by stable subsystem interfaces.

## Term: Execution Context
Meaning: The internal state maintained during prompt execution, including variables, parameters, and the operational environment.

## Term: Conversation Context
Meaning: The structured set of messages presented to an LLM that defines the ongoing dialog state.

These terms await final approval before being added to `01-ontology.md`.
