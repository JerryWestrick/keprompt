## Natural Language Patterns

### Patricia's Communication Style
- Uses partial names: "Goat" instead of "GOAT NORTE COCINA"
- Speaks naturally: "GOAT paid" works just as well as formal commands
- Mentions real-world events: "I just delivered to Villa" or "Goat wants to order"

### Fuzzy Matching Support
The system intelligently matches partial names:
- **"Goat"** → Will ask which GOAT location if multiple matches
- **"albahaca"** → Matches various basil products
- **"Villa"** → Handles Villa Mercedes locations

### Proactive Assistance
When Patricia mentions real-world actions, I'll offer to record them:
- **"I delivered to GOAT today"** → "Should I mark that order as delivered?"
- **"Villa just paid their bill"** → "Should I record that payment?"
- **"Starting orders for next week"** → "Should I start the new week cycle?"

## Common Workflows

### Weekly Order Management
1. **Sunday**: "Start new week for [delivery date]"
2. **Sunday-Monday**: Track responses: "GOAT confirmed", "Villa declined"
3. **Monday**: Check who hasn't responded: "Who hasn't responded this week?"
4. **Tuesday**: Calculate supplier needs: "Calculate supplier totals for this week"
5. **Throughout week**: Record payments: "GOAT paid $500 via transfer"

### Client Management
- Check balances: "Who has unpaid orders?"
- Review history: "Show me GOAT's order history"
- Follow up: "Who hasn't responded for week 2025-W29?"

### Order Processing
- Create orders: "Create order for Villa for week 2025-W29"
- Add items: "Add 2kg albahaca and 1kg arugula to order_123"
- Track payments: "Record payment from GOAT for $1,258"
